# Agent Context — Investments Monitor

Mirrors `CLAUDE.md` for non-Claude agents.

## What This Project Is

Streamlit portfolio monitoring app with HELOC + margin leverage analysis. Market data via yfinance. FX via Bank of Canada Valet.

## Rules

1. Read `TODO.md` before starting — source of truth for next actions.
2. Never commit secrets or credentials.
3. Push to `main` directly.
4. Keep dependencies minimal.
5. `TODO.md` is read by the Project Hub dashboard — keep it current.
6. Financial data: use high-precision decimals; verify against Canadian regulatory standards.
7. Update specs in `specs/` at the end of every session and after any major change in requirements or behaviour.

| 3 | Tech Lead / Solution Architect | Architecture trade-offs, scalability | Gemini 3 Flash |
| 4 | UX Reviewer | UI/UX, accessibility, mobile | Qwen3 Coder (Free) |
| 5 | Agent Coach | Meta-optimization of agent instructions | Gemini 3 Flash |
| 6 | Product Manager | Feature utility, MVP scope, prioritization | Gemini 3 Flash |

## Model Pool

| Model | Best For | Limitations |
|---|---|---|
| **Qwen3 Coder (Free)** | Fast lookups, small edits, structured output | Limited reasoning depth |
| **Gemini 3 Flash** | Large context, history analysis, multi-file reads | Higher latency |
| **NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Super** | Cross-document reasoning, long-form writing | Slower than free models |
| **Liquid LFM 2.5 Thinking** | Regulatory analysis, security audits, complex logic | Token-heavy |
| **DeepSeek-V4 Flash** | SQL/NoSQL schemas, precise data tasks | Narrow focus |

**Rules:**
1. Start with cheapest capable model unless context is large (>50k tokens) or task is reasoning-heavy.
2. If output quality degrades, escalate to next tier.
3. Log model switches in commit messages: `[model: Gemini 3 Flash]`

## Execution Protocol (All Agents)

For every multi-file or multi-step task:

1. **Plan first** — identify dependencies. Group by independent units.
2. **Estimate** — give time + model choice upfront before starting.
3. **Parallelize** — run independent tasks concurrently. Different models if justified.
4. **Sequential only** — when outputs feed into next steps.

| Phase | Parallel? | Model |
|---|---|---|
| Read + analyze | Sequential (once) | Qwen3 Coder (Free) |
| Write / edit files | Parallel (no dependencies) | Qwen3 or Gemini 3 Flash |
| Git operations | Parallel (repos are independent) | Qwen3 Coder (Free) |

**Rule:** Never batch unrelated work sequentially just because it's the same tool. Parallelize whenever safe.
